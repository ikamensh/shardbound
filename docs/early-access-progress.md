# Early Access progress and evidence

Criteria: [early-access-criteria.md](early-access-criteria.md).
All release gates remain incomplete unless evidence below explicitly proves
them. Last completed development milestone was a single-shard prototype;
the current goal is substantially broader.

## Baseline audit — 2026-09-05

- Authoritative baseline: `2d26787`; only unrelated `.gitignore` work was
  present when the release-quality goal began.
- Existing tests: 314 at the preceding milestone; fresh rerun underway.
- The release gap includes content/decision variety, rival strategy,
  progression choices, save robustness, usability, audio, packaging and
  release-scale testing. These are not resolved by a green baseline suite.
- Model audit reproduced a safe capital-camping strategy: by turn 65 the
  army reached level 4 with 791 gold and 66 crystals, then won at turn 68.
  Scheduled attacks provide repeated rewards without a changing opponent.
- Rival conquest can replace a four-unit eastern guard with two units,
  reducing danger when the rival expands. Crystals start at four while
  the only expense is one Mage Tower costing two.

## Gate status

G01–G19: **incomplete**. The baseline has partial evidence for basic tactical
commands (G08), public-behavior tests (G16) and framework separation (G17),
but does not satisfy their release-candidate scope.

## Current increment

Acceptance criteria recorded before implementation. Independent design,
architecture and reliability audits are identifying the next concrete
changes. No release claim or publication is authorized by this progress log.
